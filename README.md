# erfan-zsh-theme
another oh my zsh theme made by me

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

this theme is a combination of [af-magic](https://github.com/andyfleming/oh-my-zsh) theme
and [macovsky](https://github.com/championswimmer/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/macovsky.zsh-theme) theme.  
but still a unique one!
